PONYTOWN INFORMATION

i am 21, minors dni, if you int anyways, you will be ignored, or hidden if you persist.

if you are a minor: you may say hi, crown my pony, etc. don't expect a furthering in friendship, however.

i am not pro-ship, nor anti-ship. do not speak to me about this discourse. and no, i am not netural on the topic.

kin dbls dni, i'll either ignore or hide you. dni if you kin any of my friend's kins as well.

i often do not wish to speak with other people, if i ask you to leave me alone, do as i ask please, it's not hard!

"but ponytown is a social game"
this does not mean nor require i have to socialize with YOU specifically, get off your high horse.

i keep whispers to friends only, if you have something you need to say,
but don't wish to say it out loud, tell me and i'll allow you to whisper me.

overall, i am typically friendly unless you drag me into useless drama or whatever else.
